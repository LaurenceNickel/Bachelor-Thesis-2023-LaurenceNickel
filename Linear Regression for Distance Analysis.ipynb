    "Within this notebook, the machine learning algorithm linear regression is performed to predict the expression levels for the genes considering the methylation values for the CpG sites where different distances are experimented with the goal of finding which of the distances is the best to use, which denotes which CpG to use based on their location with respect to that gene, to predict the gene expression values. The dataset combination that is used to achieve this is the one with the M-transformed methylation data and the log2-transformed gene expression data. This was determined to be the best performing dataset combination within the notebook 'Linear Regression for Testing the Datasets.ipynb'. \n",

    "Linear regression is a statistical modeling technique which relates a dependent variable to one or more independent variables [1]. As the name states, linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable, but by including polynomials, it can also effectively model non-linear relationships. A line of best fit is found to relate a dependent variable to one or more independent variables, a linear equation that minimizes the sum of squared residuals. This is presented in Equation 1 where $Y$ represents the predicted gene expression value, $\\beta_0$ is the intercept (bias term), $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\ldots, \\beta_n$ are the coefficients corresponding to each CpG site, and $\\epsilon$ denotes the error term.\n",

    "\n",
    "The method Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) can be employed to estimate the coefficients $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\ldots, \\beta_n$. The OLS estimator aims to reduce the squared sum of differences between the observed and predicted values for gene expression. This is presented in Equation 2 where $\\hat{\\beta}$ represents the estimated coefficient values that minimize the sum of squared errors and $N$ the number of samples.\n",

    "Regarding the suitability of linear regression for this thesis, it can be applied to predict gene expression values from methylation data as it has already been successfully performed before, showing that linear regression is suitable for working with gene expression and methylation data [2]. Please mind that this does not mean that linear regression is necessarily the best performing (regression) method for predicting gene expression values from methylation data, but applying the algorithm might provide us with reasonable results for our purpose of finding the distance with which the dataset combination performs the best.\n",

    "For each of these distances linear regression models are built, one for each gene, and these are evaluated. The distance of the best performing experiment will represent which distance we should use to determine which CpG sites to consider (based on their position relative to a particular gene) for predicting the gene expression value of a particular gene.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike we did in the notebook 'Linear Regression for Testing the Datasets.ipynb', we will not only build models for the genes which are located on chromosome 1, which was done to reduce the computational burden, but instead we will use all of the genes present within the log2-transformed gene expression data since this notebook (among the other machine learning algorithms notebooks within this directory) represents the main experiments of the Distance Analysis part.\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve the prediction accuracy of the gene expression values, the R-squared (R<sup>2</sup>) metric is computed for each of the predictions which indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the model [3]. Higher R<sup>2</sup> values indicate a more significant proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the model, with 1 being the largest possible value. This R<sup>2</sup> value is retrieved by applying 4-fold cross-validation using the training and test splits defined in the notebook 'Training and Test Set Division.ipynb' present in the 'Machine Learning Algorithms - Preprocessing' folder, which also includes the motivation behind choosing the k in k-fold cross-validation to be set equal to four, and averaging the R<sup>2</sup> value for each of the four folds."

    "To retrieve the prediction accuracy of the gene expression values, the R-squared (R<sup>2</sup>) metric is computed for each of the predictions which indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the model [3]. Higher R<sup>2</sup> values indicate a more significant proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the model, with 1 being the largest possible value. This R<sup>2</sup> value is retrieved by applying 4-fold cross-validation using the training and test splits defined in the notebook 'Training and Test Set Division.ipynb' present in the 'Machine Learning Algorithms - Preprocessing' folder, which also includes the motivation behind choosing the k in k-fold cross-validation to be set equal to four, and averaging the R<sup>2</sup> value for each of the four folds. The resulting R<sup>2</sup> values for each of the genes for each of the distances listed above will be visualized within a single box plot in the notebook 'Analyzing Linear Regression Results for Distance Analysis'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we do not want to define a different section for each of the different distances used as this might cause the notebook to become cluttered and difficult to follow and navigate through, we will first define a list featuring all of the distances defined above which will be experimented with. These distances will be divided into 8 blocks of 5 distances because when they all appear within the same code block as it is quite a memory expensive computation (and we do not want to lose any progress) which allows us to save a different DataFrame for each of the 8 blocks which can later be easily recombined into a single DataFrame for displaying purposes.
